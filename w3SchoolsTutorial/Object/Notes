A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

Object      Properties                      Methods

car         car.name = Fiat                 car.start()

            car.model = 500                 car.drive()

            car.weight = 850kg              car.brake()

            car.color = white               car.stop()

JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

Accessing Object Properties
You can access object properties in two ways:

objectName.propertyName
or
objectName["propertyName"]

A method is a function stored as a property.

Example
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

The this Keyword
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.
