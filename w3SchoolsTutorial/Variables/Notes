After the declaration of a variable in JavaScript, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

Example
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
